# Web Kinect
 - HTTP Web server to allow using Microsoft Kinect in web pages trough [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).
    - Works with Kinect 1.0 only should be easily adaptable to work with Kinect 2.0 but I do not have access to one for testing.
 - Allows raw access to the Kinect cameras information (Depth and Color image) and access to the human skeleton generated by the [Kinect SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561).
 - The server runs by default in the `localhost` at port `8181` the browser should be able to communicate with the server without additional configurations even on HTTPS.
 - A compiled version of the program is available on the `bin` folder in the root of the Git repository.



### Usage Example

- There is a usage example available in the example page intended to be used alongside with [three.js](https://threejs.org/)

- The communication with the server is performed using  `JSON` encoded messages for the skeleton data and `Blob` encoded binary data for the images captured from the cameras.
- Here is a basic example of how we can exchange information with the Kinect server.

```javascript
var socket = new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8181");
var connected = false;

socket.onopen = function() {
	connected = true;
};

socket.onclose = function() {
	connected = false;
};

socket.onmessage = function(event) {
	// Skeleton data
	if(typeof event.data === "string") {
		var data = JSON.parse(event.data);
		// ...
	}
	// Camera feed
	else if(event.data instanceof Blob) {
		var camera = event.data;
        var url = URL.createObjectURL(event.data);
		// ...
	}
};
```
